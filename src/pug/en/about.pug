        p Riszart Daryl (riszart.v.c.2250@gmail.com)
        p Hello reader, I am a professional web developer (focused on JavaScript) with about a year and a half of experience developing frontend focused projects with HTML, CSS and JavaScript technologies, as well as using preprocessors like sass and pug for larger projects.
        P In the JavaScript part, I am currently focusing on making projects with API, fetch to make calls to the backend bringing data that is used to modify part of the DOM of the page and therefore make it more interactive and friendly.
        p I started with programming when I was in high school, with a focus more on electrical systems, after finishing high school I became more interested in programming outside of the industry focus (processor programming, plc, etc.) and since then I began to study it. in a more self-taught way with the help of the Youtube platform and Platzi: 
        p I started by learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript, after learning them I moved on to HTML and CSS preprocessors
        p I am currently learning more about js and in parallel nodejs.
        p In addition to studying, I am doing projects in JavaScript, doing practices with promises, objects, APIs, etc.
        p to improve my skills, which has taught me a lot. Previously, I studied at the SENATI Institute of the career (Industrial Mechatronics) where I learned about programming: processor programming, PLC programming, etc. As well as I have also acquired knowledge of other areas such as:
